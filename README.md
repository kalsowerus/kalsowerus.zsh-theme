# Install

First, clone the repository:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/kalsowerus/zsh-theme.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/kalsowerus
```

Then create a symlink in the `custom/themes` directory:

```zsh
ln -s ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/kalsowerus/kalsowerus.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/kalsowerus.zsh-theme
```

You can now select the theme by setting `ZSH_THEME="kalsowerus"` in your `.zshrc`.
